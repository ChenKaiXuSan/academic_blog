In this paper, we propose improved Generative Adversarial Networks with attention module in Generator, which can enhance the effectiveness of Generator. Furthermore, recent work has shown that Generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we explored the effect of different normalization (spectral normalization, instance normalization) on Generator and Discriminator. Moreover, an enhanced loss function called Wasserstein Divergence distance, can alleviate the problem of difficult to train module in practice.
