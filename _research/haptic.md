## Haptic Research Overview

This research focuses on **haptic interaction and tactile feedback systems** that enable intuitive and reliable communication between humans and intelligent machines. By integrating **haptic devices**, **sensor-based perception**, and **artificial intelligence**, the work aims to design feedback mechanisms that convey rich physical information through touch.

A key challenge addressed in this research is the **mapping between perception and sensation**. Complex environmental states, human motion, or system outputs must be translated into meaningful haptic cues that are perceptually interpretable and responsive. To this end, the research explores **data-driven haptic encoding strategies**, where visual, motion, or force-related information is transformed into adaptive tactile feedback.

Technically, the research investigates **closed-loop haptic systems** that combine real-time sensing, intelligent decision-making, and feedback generation. Machine learning models are employed to adapt haptic responses based on user state, task context, and environmental uncertainty, enabling more effective guidance, training, and interaction.

The ultimate goal is to develop **human-centered haptic interfaces** that enhance perception, motor learning, and safety across applications such as **medical assistance, sports training, and human–machine collaboration**.
