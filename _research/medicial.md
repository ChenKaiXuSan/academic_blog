My medical research focuses on developing **video-based intelligent systems** for **clinical motion analysis and diagnosis**, with an emphasis on **human gait and posture assessment**. By integrating **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **multi-view geometry**, I aim to extract clinically meaningful motion representations from ordinary video data and translate them into reliable diagnostic insights.

A central challenge in medical video analysis is the gap between **data-driven models** and **clinical interpretability**. To address this, my work emphasizes **phase-aware and attention-guided modeling**, enabling neural networks to focus on diagnostically relevant body regions and motion phases (e.g., stance/swing cycles in gait). This design not only improves classification performance but also enhances **model transparency**, which is critical for clinical adoption.

Technically, my research explores **multimodal fusion frameworks** that combine RGB video, optical flow, skeletal keypoints, and domain priors into unified learning architectures. I further investigate **multi-view 3D pose reconstruction** and temporal refinement techniques to achieve robust motion estimation under unconstrained camera setups, making the approach applicable to real-world clinical environments.

Ultimately, my goal is to build **interpretable, scalable, and non-invasive medical AI systems** that support clinicians in **screening, diagnosis, and longitudinal monitoring** of movement-related disorders, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and more accessible healthcare technologies.
