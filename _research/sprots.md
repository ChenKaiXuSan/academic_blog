## Sports Research Overview

This research focuses on **video-based sports analytics** for understanding, evaluating, and improving human movement in athletic activities. By leveraging **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **3D human pose estimation**, the work aims to extract fine-grained motion representations from video data and translate them into actionable insights for performance analysis and injury prevention.

A key emphasis is placed on **technique-aware and phase-aware motion modeling**, enabling the analysis of complex sports movements such as cyclic actions, rapid transitions, and whole-body coordination. These models are designed to capture both spatial posture and temporal dynamics, which are essential for assessing movement quality and efficiency in sports.

Technically, the research investigates **multimodal learning frameworks** that integrate RGB video, optical flow, skeletal keypoints, and biomechanical cues. In addition, **multi-view 3D reconstruction** and temporal refinement techniques are explored to achieve robust motion estimation under unconstrained outdoor and competition environments.

The ultimate goal is to develop **interpretable and scalable sports AI systems** that support athlete training, performance optimization, and movement safety, bridging advanced computer vision research with real-world sports science applications.
