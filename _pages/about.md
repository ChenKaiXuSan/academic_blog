I am **KaiXu Chen (陳凱旭)**, a researcher at the [**Center for Computational Sciences (CCS)**](https://www.ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp/eng/), University of Tsukuba, Japan. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering in 2025 at the University of Tsukuba under the supervision of **Prof. Yoshihiro Kuroda** in the [Life Engineering Lab](https://www.lelab.jp/).

Originally from China, I moved to Japan for my graduate studies, completing a Master of Engineering at Kanazawa University and then a Ph.D. at the University of Tsukuba. 
My research focuses on **computer vision** and **medical image analysis**, with an emphasis on deep learning and generative models (such as GANs) for healthcare applications. In particular, I aim to develop intelligent systems that allow machines to interpret visual data and assist in medical diagnostics, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.

Beyond my core research, I am passionate about scientific outreach and education. I maintain a technical blog where I share insights from my research and development work, with the goal of making complex machine learning and computer vision concepts accessible to a broader audience.
